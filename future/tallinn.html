              <div class="description"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE</span> cyberwarfare headquarters of the most powerful military alliance in history are not housed in the Pentagon. They cannot be found in a futuristic Silicon Valley office campus, nor in a compound in the Nevada desert. Instead, they are a group of five small buildings bordered by a highway to the east and south, a stand of trees to the north, and a military cemetery with a bronze statue of a soldier to the west. This is Tallinn, a city of 450,000 people first founded in 1248 along what is now the northern coast of Estonia, on the Gulf of Finland. Tallinn is an eye-catching city with an Old Town comprised of white buildings with red-tiled roofs--it also serves as the capital of Estonia--but for our purposes today it is the home of the NATO CCD COE, a.k.a. the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

              <div class="description">To find out why the information security apparatus of the NATO powers is concentrated in such a seemingly arbitrary locale, we have to go back to the mid-2000s. Estonia has embraced the internet in a manner unrivaled among any nation: it began building infrastructure for online governance in 1997 and even has an electronic residency and national ID system in addition to online voting in elections. However, the former Soviet republic has continued to grapple with a difficult legacy of decades of occupation and the persistent interest Russia holds in antagonizing its smaller neighbors.
              <p></p>
              	When the BBC reported on the cyber defense capabilities of the Baltic republic in April 2017, it pointed to a singular incident as a catalyst; that same incident is referenced in reports from the Center for European Policy Analysis and Wired. Remember the bronze statue in the cemetery bordering the NATO CCD COE? In April of 2007, that statue of a Russian soldier stood in a small park in central Tallinn. The Estonian government, in its continuing reconciliation with its Soviet past, relocated the statue to the cemetery where it now stands. This sparked two nights of deadly rioting in Tallinn and coincided with the beginning of a massive wave of cyberattacks on Estonian banks, news outlets, telecoms, and government agencies. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks “came from Russian IP addresses” and “online instructions were in the Russian language” (<a href=”http://www.bbc.com/news/39655415”>BBC</a>). In the world of cybercrime, however, attribution is next to impossible. The level of anonymity afforded by the internet means that it may never be definitively known whether these attacks were organized by the Russian Federation or by a loose grouping of privateer hackers.
              <p></p>
              	The Estonian security apparatus was permanently shaken by these attacks. The Ministry of Defense formed a Cyber Defense Unit, comprised of volunteers, “the sort of private sector talent the state could never usually afford to employ” (<a href=”http://www.bbc.com/news/39655415”>BBC</a>). In 2008, NATO granted the CCD COE full accreditation as an international military organization. Estonia is currently an international model for cyberdefense, but other former Warsaw Pact countries have since served as a testing ground for elements of Russian cybercrime: waves of attacks that largely crippled Ukraine in October 2015 were traced back to Russian IP addresses.</div>

              <div class="description">The Cold War-era proxy conflicts that pitted NATO against the USSR in the Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and other places haven’t petered out. Instead, new digital versions are being waged every day in a format that would be genius if it wasn’t so malicious. Cyberattacks are almost impossible to trace to specific individuals, which gives aggressor states a massive upper hand. It is also unclear at what point a cyberattack on a NATO member would lead to the invocation of Article 5, the section of the NATO charter that ensures that an attack on any one member is recognized as an attack on every member. The agility required for navigating this gray area means that small to midsized countries can play an outsized role in cyberdefense, a characteristic not limited to Estonia. Singapore ranks in first place on the U.N.’s Global Cybersecurity Index, and Israel’s powerful military industrial apparatus has spun off new startups and agencies designed to protect Israeli cyberspace.
              <p></p>
              	According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “In 2016, [Israel] had about 20% of the global private cybersecurity investment” (<a href=”http://www.bbc.com/news/39655415”>Forbes</a>). In fact, Israeli cyberdefense talent is cultivated as early as middle school, and continues through high school and universities to provide the first PhD in cybersecurity--that is, a degree not in the general field of computer science but specifically in cybersecurity--in the world. Large contractors and nimble startups alike recruit top talent from the military’s mandatory service to form the more than three hundred Israeli cybersecurity firms. Altogether, these companies exported an estimated $6.5 billion in related services, a sizable boon to the country’s economy.
              <p></p>
              	Israel and Estonia are obviously both early adopters of not only cybersecurity technology, but also the infrastructure necessary to implement it and the culture necessary to ensure its success for posterity. These two countries clearly benefit from being small enough to quickly roll out improvements to their systems, but if the future of larger nations looks anything like theirs does, the developed world can hope for a few key developments: a better-educated public, a thriving private cybersecurity industry, close cooperation between corporate and government entities, billions of dollars pouring into research and development, and a passionate crowd of largely young people constantly pushing for the implementation of the newest generation of protections.
              <p></p>
              	The coming decades of cybersecurity research and response in our volatile geopolitical atmosphere may stem as much from a dorm room at MIT as from the Pentagon, but one matter is certain: for the time being, the global order of information technology rests in the hands of a few dedicated individuals in a small office park in Tallinn, Estonia, a stone’s throw from the bronze statue that started it all.&#8718;
