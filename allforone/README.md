## Synopsis

This repository contains the code and images for http://thebridgepapers.com, a citizen journalism venture.

## Motivation

This repository was created as a self-imposed challenge to avoid traditional hosting and website template sources, such as WordPress or Squarespace, while still creating an aesthetically pleasing and innovative website. The aim was to implement a three-by-three boostrap grid that would correspond to eight articles and a description section.

## Contributors
