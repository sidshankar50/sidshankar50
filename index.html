								About Us
							</p>
							<div style="margin-left: 12px;">
								<p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The Bridge Papers is a groundbreaking experiment in citizen journalism. In an era when the power of the media grows in lockstep with the polarization of politics, the American people consistently seem to be divided between ourselves, due in part to the news sources we choose to consume and the issues we choose to care about. For most of us, the truth is that there are entirely hidden subcultures and issues around us, ones that we have never thought to explore.</p>
								<p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>In the fall of 2016, our team members (five students from central New Jersey) chose to adopt the resolve and vision necessary to share our worlds with the public. With topics ranging from flag design to the broken systems of American soccer, this first volume brings together eight parts of our global community. 'ALL FOR ONE,' the titular reference to Alexandre Dumas, draws every piece towards the theme of solidarity and self-improvement.</p>
								<p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Our commitment to quality content extends beyond the pieces we wrote for this inaugural volume. We made a point to reach out to leaders in our community who bring unique perspectives to their work, and we would like to thank <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Louise Tokarsky-Unda</span>, <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Dr. Micheal McDonough</span>, and ______ for joining us in a better future. We are happy to announce that our New Media platform extends beyond our website, with an upcoming <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebridgepapers/">Instagram page</a> and the homepage of our sibling organization, <a href="http://www.projectbreakthecycle.com/">Project Break The Cycle</a>. Our code is fully scripted in-house, and our open-source GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/thebridgepapers/thebridgepapers.github.io">here</a>.</p>

									Oppressed perspectives and issues lie within the shadows of our society. Jesus’s work focuses around addressing those concerns. For the past 13 years of living in the United States, he has encountered the maladies that plague our society, while also experiencing the American privileges that the rest of the world envies. Jesus’s involvement in local government and social advocacy extends to his participation in the Bound Brook Democrats, the Bound Brook Special Improvement District, the Somerset County Youth Leadership Program, and El Foro Comunitario de Inmigracion.<p></p>‘To see injustice and do nothing about that means to participate in it’ - Jean-Jacques Rousseau

								<p style="margin-left: 12px;">
									Sid is honored to serve as the Publisher for this first volume of The Bridge Papers. Pulling together our team and community contacts to create this project was an amazing experience. He was fortunate enough to be an intern in Assemblyman Dr. Andrew Zwicker, PhD.’s office this past summer, and he found that growing more involved in the local political sphere was an invaluable journey. He has always had a great interest in government, technology, and design, and so creating a common home for all three has been a longstanding goal of Sid’s. He hopes to carry the standard of citizen journalism into the future, and sees unending potential in The Bridge Papers. Additionally, serving alongside Farouk Marhaba as Executive Director of Project Break The Cycle, collaborating with Noah Rodelius on <a href="http://noahrodeli.us">noahrodeli.us</a>, and playing a leadership role in his high school debate club have shown him more of the world and of his hometown than he previously thought possible. Here’s to another 16 years, and many more volumes of TBP.

Generations of Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, Mohawk and Seneca people killed each other in revenge for previous killings.  Mothers lost husbands and children.  Survivors were psychologically damaged.  There was instability, and the people were perpetually mourning.  It seemed as though all hope had been lost.  People had forgotten the benefit of peace: that it allows society to prosper, ensures the security of future generations, allows individuals to reach their fullest constructive potential.</p> <div class='blockQuote'>Nothing and no one is beyond hope.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>In the midst of this warfare arrived a man with a message of peace.  He floated across the lake in a stone canoe; through peace, even things that seem impossible can be accomplished.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>This man was not arrogant, and recognized his limitations.  He wasn't a gifted public speaker, so he had an assistant, Hiawatha, who delivered his peaceful message in a way that grabbed the public's attention.  Fine oratory was a prized skill among the Iroquois.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The Peacemaker's message seemed simple: stop the cycle of revenge, forgive each other for past wrongs, and dispose of all weapons of war.  If everyone from all five of the nations would do this, then future generations would have a chance at a productive, constructive life.  The women saw the benefits that peace could bring to their children and grandchildren.  The leaders of the various nations also knew that what the Peacemaker said made good sense, but one man remained vehemently opposed.  His name was Tadodarho, and he ruled people through fear, pitting them against one another.  He threatened, killed, scared, and intimidated his people.  Worst of all, he encouraged them to find excuses to kill, focusing on differences as justifications for hating, which made it easier for people to kill.  He was so evil that his body was twisted and snakes lived in his hair.</p>"

				"<div class='blockQuote2'>Through peace, even things that seem impossible can be accomplished.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The Peacemaker knew that anyone who rules through fear is an impediment to peaceful unification.  Instead of maligning Tadodarho, or dismissing him as being beyond help, he and his supporters massaged the unnatural twists out of his body, gave him medicinal herbs, soothed him with words of peace and encouragement, and combed the snakes from his hair.  Tadodarho was, in this moment, transformed into a true human and realized the value of peaceful unification.</p> <p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The tree of peace was planted, and a hole dug at its base, where the five [previously] warring nations deposited all their weapons, which were then swept away by an underground river to the four cardinal directions, scattered forever.  They no longer focused on past differences, instead choosing to move forward together, to build a safe and prosperous society for their children. They realized they would ALL benefit from this.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>This story contains a powerful lesson, one that is applicable to us, here and now.  There are always Tadodarhos who rule through fear, anger, and intimidation.  Like the original Tadodarho, they scare us into finding excuses to attack each other, then to seek revenge for attacks.  They like it when we blame each other.  Sometimes we become our own Tadodarhos.  But change is possible.  Nothing and no one is beyond hope.  If we demonstrate, through our actions and speech, the  potential that peaceful unity has for creating prosperity and ensuring the wellbeing of future generations then we, too, can comb the snakes from our hair.</p>"

Unexpectedly, however, voter turnout only increased by 1% compared to 2012, contrary to early voting records showing high levels of engagement. Ballot counts show that only 55% of eligible citizens cast a ballot, but where are the other 45%. In an election where candidates shouted over each other to be heard, what was the reason for so many citizens remaining silent?</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>With multiple Supreme Court justices potentially set to retire, new court nominations are going to be made by the next president. These are the people who dictate law in America and the upcoming nominations will thus have an impact on our nation for the next several decades. Despite this, many claim that politics doesn't matter, or that whoever the president is will not affect people's current situations-- the poor would stay poor and the rich even more so.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Politics can oftentimes become too personal, which dissuades people from discussing it in polite conversation. If and when politics is discussed, many touch upon it only superficially. People may discuss current political states and mention issues, but never dig beyond the surface to investigate further into the issues. These norms stifle discourse on matters that have tangible and life-changing effects: matters of war, healthcare, and race. They may be personal, but that is entirely the point. They affect our people, for better or for worse. When societal issues that deal with politics are ignored by voters and commentators who claim impartiality, they may be inadvertently harming the American public in the name of ‘journalistic balance’ or inoffensiveness. As John Oliver has exposed, news shows may peg one debater who understands that global warming is real next to another who does not, which portrays that either perspective is equally valid when in reality 97% of scientists support the factual consensus on global warming. The opinions of silent figures will not suffer public scrutiny, but their lack of engagement regarding issues shows that they do not care enough about all the citizens of our nation. Families are worried about being torn apart. People are scared of losing their rights. People's futures are in flux, and our custody of our environment is on the line. People's lives are at stake.</p><div class='blockQuote'> A chance not taken is everyone's loss.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The importance of politics needs to be impressed upon America’s youth from an early age. Although instructors may not want to impose a bias upon students, it is important for students to understand the effects that politics can have on their lives. As non-voters, due to age restrictions, students may assume that their opinions on politics do not matter, or it may be that news sources and political parties do not make an effort to target them.</p>"

				"<p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>With large increases in 18 year olds that register to vote each year, it is obvious that they are shaping the future of the electorate. If interest in politics is instilled in children at an early age, their development in understanding the importance of politics will help carry them through when they become registered voters. It is imperative for America’s youth to have a basic understanding of politics. Political decisions in America dictate economic and social statuses of all Americans. As millions of students pursue their interests in a wide range of occupations, all students must understand that the workforce is reliant on political decision-making. </p><div class='blockQuote2'>“Young people today want to see a change. They want a better world.”<p></p> - Sir Richard Branson </div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Choices regarding college and tuition are political as well. If young students were to have an interest in being politically active, there would be more advocates who would strive to ensure that the transition into adulthood becomes less of a burden on America’s youth. Those with the loudest voices in politics tend to receive attention. With no advocacy, the debate on student debt would only subdue, and high student unemployment rates would become a meaningless statistic. Although these issues do currently receive a substantial amount of attention, our government has failed to deliver significant action to address them. Year after year, debates on issues regarding college have just remained empty words. </p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Additionally, economic policies affect college tuition and job opportunities. With the right policies in place, concern over the future of our country’s youth can be alleviated. In order to execute these goals, however, more students need to voice their concerns. Students must be proactive and take control over their issues, and learn to speak for themselves. Although students cannot control what politicians do, they can say something about it. Rather than just thinking that a change is not possible, students should embrace the rights they are entitled to, and use them for the good of society. A chance not taken is everyone's loss.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Despite the political activity of the elderly and the role of parents in paying off student debt, the youth of our nation cannot let other hold the mantle. America’s children's’ future is not ensured. New administrations and politicians have the capability to change course. As the public, we have the power to select these people, and through them we can make sure that our involvement in politics is not ignored. Our youth matter. The stereotype of only “old people” being interested in politics should not stand. It is not just for adults. Millennials face problems too, and it is millenials who will be at the helm of politics in the coming future. Change will come through the new generation of politically involved individuals, whether the old guard appreciates it or not. The future is young and restless.</p> "

In its infancy, it was believed to be completely ineffective due to its radical nature; however, all doubts were silenced by its large-scale positive effects. Resulting from civil disobedience, many protesters have found that they have been able to ignite the desired changes due to their actions.  A well known figure associated with civil disobedience is Mahatma Gandhi: India’s freedom fighter. Gandhi was influenced by Jain ideas and beliefs, specifically the principle of Ahimsa. Ahimsa is the belief in the promotion of non-violence, and that one should refrain from harming any living thing.

We believe that the body is non-living and the soul is the living aspect, and because of the soul the body can carry out actions. Therefore, when a Jain individual passes away, the family believes that the soul passes on to another body and the presence of sins is what prevents an individual from breaking the circle of birth and death. To build on this, sins and bad karma from previous lives carry over and can possibly disable an individual from attaining moksha (liberation from the cycle of life in death). If an individual is able to destroy these sins--through a variety of different actions--then he or she is able to attain moksha: the ultimate achievement in Jainism.</p><div class='blockQuote2'>With only 6 to 7 million followers worldwide, Jainism is one of the smallest global religions.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Although many ideas and concepts culminate to form the beliefs that dictate Jainism, they all interrelated and it is safe to say that the overarching principle is Ahimsa. As mentioned before, Ahimsa is the belief in nonviolence towards all living things. This belief is central to the Jain belief of karma. By inflicting pain on other living beings, an individual is gaining bad karma and bad karma leads to continuing the cycle of life and death. Ideally, the goal in life as per Jain values is to destroy all bad karma and ultimately end the cycle of life and death. Not only that, Ahimsa explains why Jains are vegetarian and why they have a very strict dietary code. Along with avoiding meat, this code involves not eating any root vegetables as they tend to contain more bacteria and killing them is considered a sin in the Jain religion The broader concept of this intertwined belief has much greater implications. Essentially, this displays the negative ramifications associated with harming an individual. This urges people to not just treat others with respect, but also with compassion. In a perfect world governed by non violence and Ahimsa, the large number of conflicts facing us today would not exist.</p>"

				"<p><span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 24pt;'>When most people</span> hear the word 'Lebanon,' they immediately associate my words with the town in New Jersey. However, Lebanon is also a small country in the Middle East. Its location near the ancient Mesopotamian cradle of civilization, known as the 'fertile crescent,' gives Lebanon its rich history in language, culture, food,  and agriculture. People can enjoy themselves at the beautiful beaches and waterfront resorts, or they can travel up into the mountains and take in the fresh air and spectacular views. Olive trees blanket the country, and their presence is felt in the rich Lebanese cuisine.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;'>Unfortunately, not all of Lebanon is perfect and stable. The country struggles with political corruption, as well as drastic rates of poverty. Children are being taken out of school to labor in low-paying jobs in order to support their families. Alcohol and drugs are rampant in poverty-stricken neighborhoods, and addictions tear apart families.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>When their educations get compromised, young children are not able to grow and learn like other students. This ultimately puts them at a disadvantage, because they will not get the same job opportunities as the educated individuals, thus trapping them in a cycle of poverty. Not all hope is lost, however, because organizations such as the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare aim to get children out of this cycle and into the real world. <p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Every year, during my summer trip to Lebanon, I see the painful effects of poverty. Although statistics say that the poverty rate is around 20%, many sources neglect to mention that the poverty line is set at $2000 per year, absolutely nowhere near enough money for a person to live on. I had to do something about this issue. I refused to sit and watch people suffer from the cycle of poverty.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>In March of 2016, I started an organization called Project Break The Cycle. We aim to break the cycle of poverty by digging into the root of the problem: education. Childhood education is very crucial in third-world countries. If you do not receive an education, your chances of finding a well-paying job are slim to none. If you don’t have a well-paying job, then your kids cannot have a good education. The cycle repeats itself from there. By providing an education for these children, we are able to lift them up, and empower them to build a sustainable future. It’s such an easy solution, but political interests and corporate power deviate the focus from poverty and towards money or the current political climate.</p>"

I was able to see every aspect of the center, from the bedroom to the kitchen and playground. It was a truly humbling opportunity. Walking into the center gave me a feeling of warmth and hospitality, even though it was not in the best condition. There were no children there, though, because it was during summer break. During this time, the children return to their parents because they need them to work cheap, exploitative day jobs to generate another source of revenue for the family. </p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>However, I was blessed to be able to meet one boy who came back the day I visited. (To protect his privacy, I won’t mention his name.) As soon as I approached him to say “Hi,” he started a very interesting conversation with me about the game he was playing. It was on an old computer in a room located adjacent to the main hall. When Ms. Ziadeh, the director of the center, followed me into the room, she noticed his ripped t-shirt. She always makes sure that her kids went out wearing new and clean clothes, because it contributes to the psychological development of the child. It turned out his parents took his new clothes, and sent him back to the center with a pre-owned, dirty, and ripped shirt. The parents took advantage of the center, and used it for their own benefits. Unfortunately, the child was unaware the whole time. Instead of making a fuss about it, Ms. Ziadeh returned from the closet and handed him a brand new t-shirt. She took his ripped one away from him.</p> <p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>This tableau gave me an insight into the reality of some lives within the cycle of poverty in Lebanon. The complicated nature of the issue had structural and institutional aspects, of course, but poverty is also a deeply personal issue that tears at families the same way it tears at economies. However, as a global community, it is our job to address the roots of the problem and find a solution. Not only does early-childhood education get these children off of the streets, it also allows them to live the proper life they deserve. </p><hr></hr><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Join <a href='http://www.projectbreakthecycle.com'>PBTC for our official website launch</a>, which is coming very soon.

For most of us, the truth is that there are entirely hidden subcultures and issues around us, ones that we have never thought to explore.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>In the fall of 2016, our team members (five students from central New Jersey) chose to adopt the resolve and vision necessary to share our worlds with the public. With topics ranging from flag design to the broken systems of American soccer, this first volume brings together eight parts of our global community. 'ALL FOR ONE,' the titular reference to Alexandre Dumas, draws every piece towards the theme of solidarity and self-improvement.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Our commitment to quality content extends beyond the pieces we wrote for this inaugural volume. We made a point to reach out to leaders in our community who bring unique perspectives to their work, and we would like to thank <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Dr. Louise Tokarsky-Unda</span>, <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Dr. Micheal McDonough</span>, and ______ for joining us in a better future. We are happy to announce that our New Media platform extends beyond our website, with an upcoming <a href='https://www.instagram.com/thebridgepapers/'>Instagram page</a> and the homepage of our sibling organization, <a href='http://www.projectbreakthecycle.com/'>Project Break The Cycle</a>.

Sounds easy enough, and yet not one municipality nor county has created a successful flag in New Jersey. From Bernards to Burlington, all place names, complex seals, or mottos across the banner. The foremost purpose of a flag is nonverbal representation; if your flag has to have your name across it, it&rsquo;s not given a chance to do its job. In fact, even our state flag overcomplicates itself with a seal thrown in the middle, which defeats the entire purpose of recognizable symbolism. How many third-graders can draw that flag from memory?</p><img src='currentFlag.gif' alt='currentFlag' width=100% id='currentFlag' style='margin-bottom: 20px;'/><div class='blockQuote'> Our current flag.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 12px;'>I figure that Somerset County is the perfect place to start some symbol reform. It has solid design precedent, and it&rsquo;s local enough to make change feasible but large enough to have an impact. The current flag has a dark blue seal with 21 stars, a silhouette of the county, and two ribbons, top and bottom. The stars are supposed to represent the 21 municipalities of the county, and the ribbons display the name of the county and the year of its founding. </p>"

				"<p style='margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 12px;'>As far as flags go, it&rsquo;s rather complicated and could do without words or a seal. The flag fails to be a distinctive identifier. Part of that is the absence of the symbol in public life, and lowering the barrier of access to the flag by simplifying its design will make it easier to incorporate into life in Somerset County. Flags and other public symbols are powerful signifiers of the values of a community and a distinctive flag presents a fresh new face to visitors and investors, a quality that would be singular in our state.</p><img src='Flag.png' alt='profile' width=100% id='flag'style='margin-bottom: 20px;'/><div class='blockQuote2'>The proposed design.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 12px;'>A flag that retains the same color scheme while distilling down the original&rsquo;s attributes would be a welcome change; a simple yellow background with a blue circle and a white bar bridging them together. The yellow background and blue circle would be an homage to the original flag, with the yellow representing the background of the state flag and the blue circle representing the world. Looking forward into the future, Somerset County will only become more diverse, drawing people from all across the globe. Recognizing our shared tie to our home at the same time as our varied backgrounds is the perfect way to bring our flag into the 21st century.</p>"

In great contrast to that, there are upwards of 100 Brazilian players, who are also more highly rated than the Americans. Why is this? Scouting in the sport of soccer is the act of searching for youth talent, with the intent to eventually bring the young players into the professional team, known as the first team. In most foreign countries this is a common practice in order for new, skilled players to replace older and retiring players. Scouts sent out by professional clubs will scour a given region for any hot prospects to bring directly into the youth academy of the professional team. Over the years, there have been countless stories following poverty-stricken children catching a break and being scouted by a professional club. Famous Brazilian players such as Neymar and Pele both came from incredibly poor backgrounds. However, they were talented enough to be noticed by scouts, and eventually taken into a professional club's youth setup. This lead to both of their astronomical rises as spectacular professional players and the dramatic shift of their lives from dirt poor to ridiculously rich. These stories are still being made today, in fact they are constantly being made everywhere around the world besides the USA.</p><div class='blockQuote'>American players are being poached by foreign teams.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>So why is it, despite the USA’s clear dominance in other sports, that soccer is our weak spot? Soccer in America is fairly new, having formed its first real professional league in 1968, with most other countries already having leagues in place for a few half-centuries. American soccer is less advanced than its counterparts in countries that take the game seriously due to the prevailing norms in youth development. Unlike countries such as Brazil, you don’t get scouted by professional teams when you are 10 years old. Instead, the journey would start with a young player joining a club team. This progresses to playing high level high school soccer. With the combination of playing on a club team and a high school team, a college scout might offer a player a scholarship or a place to play on a college team. If not, the journey stops there for the former dreamer. If the player does get included in a college team, they have only stepped over one more barrier in the path to becoming a pro. Only after years of college soccer does the MLS superdraft come. This is where the professional teams pick and sign around 14 college players each. Fourteen players for 30 professional teams (including 10 teams from the NASL, the second tier of American soccer) is not a lot of players at all; it’s a pathetic ratio. Considering the sheer amount of players that go through college, a majority never even have the chance to play professionally. </p>"

				"<p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>On the other hand, this robbery of opportunity does not occur in most other countries that utilize scouts. In Spain, there have been countless examples of the use of scouts proving to be effective, most notably in the case of Lionel Messi. When he was only 13 years old, Spanish scouts brought Messi from Argentina to Spain, giving him a contract and offering him a spot on their U-14 team. Today, he has won 5 Ballon D’or awards and is considered to be the best player of all time. The purpose of pointing this out is to show that in no other countries is college an integral part of becoming a pro, and so the American system should be reformed to fit reality.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Today, however, American players are being poached by foreign teams. <a href='https://www.whoscored.com/Players/302692/Show/Christian-Pulisic'>Christian Pulisic</a>, a now 18-year-old phenom, was the youngest non-German scorer in the Bundesliga (German Soccer League) at a mere 17 years and 212 days (youngest being 17 years and 82 days). How did an American at such a young age start to play professionally? The short answer is that he skipped the American system. In February of 2015, a 16-year-old Pulisic moved to Germany to play with the club team Borussia Dortmund. He trained with the U17 team until the summer of 2016, when he moved up to train with the U19 team. During January of 2016 the then 17-year-old was called up to train with the first team. Pulisic has also broken records on the international level, playing with the US Men's National Team. In March of 2016, Pulisic broke the record for being the youngest American to play a World Cup qualifying match for the United States. A week later, he broke the record for being the youngest American to score for the United States national team.</p><div class='blockQuote2'>Considering the sheer amount of players that go through college, a majority never even have the chance to play professionally.</div><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The negative effects of this four year system are blatant. In scouting and developing players, the goal is to prepare a player to a point in which they can perform on a professional level through intense training at a young age. Pulisic’s youthful success serves as a proof of concept. There are currently over 150 professional players under the age of 22 playing in the world's most watched league, the English Premier League. The four extra years of preliminary soccer in the US are useless and are certainly detrimental to a player's potential pro career. </p><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>If the US implemented a decent system of scouting throughout the country, America could soon be as dominant in soccer as they are in most other sports. Recognizing true talent early in careers through scouts and nurturing it to become insurmountable is how pro teams achieve success today. Currently in the ‘States, however, college scouts are the only prevalent type of talent search. The college system has been integrated into the soccer culture of the US, and it has ultimately hindered it. Sure, it has created a new platform of competition through college soccer, but why go through the trouble of an extra step that limits players from going professional? Using the example of Christian Pulisic, a 17 year old American who went pro, we can surely deduce that there is hidden talent all over the US, waiting to be found.</p>"

Some historians claim that the stadium holds the world record for longest continuous use for football – 141 years and counting. A statue of Sir Tom Finney welcomes fans, a fitting tribute to Preston’s greatest player. Finney was born in Deepdale and played his entire career for Preston. Currently, Preston North End reside in the Championship League in twelfth place with 8 wins, 4 draws, and 8 losses.

It traces its origins to an Institute founded in 1828. Harris Art College was established in 1932, becoming Harris College in 1952. Then, in 1973, the name changed to Preston Polytechnic. Full university status was granted in 1992. Today, UClan enrolls over 30,000 students and is located in the old city center.</p><hr></hr><img src='Preston Bus Station.jpg' alt='Preston Bus Station' id='busstation' width=100% style='margin-bottom: 20px;'/><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Preston is home to the ugliest bus station in the world – Preston Bus Station. It opened in 1969 and has space for 80 double-decker buses. It reflects the brutalist style of architecture and some historians assert that it is the largest bus station in Europe. I have lost count of how many times I took the #126 Ribble bus into this station (and to begin one too many pub crawls).</p><hr></hr><img src='Battle of Preston.jpg' alt='Battle of Preston' id='battleofpreston' width=100% style='margin-bottom: 20px;'/><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>The Battle of Preston (1648) offered a decisive parliamentarian victory during the English Civil War. Oliver Cromwell, scourge of fun times everywhere, commanding an army of about 9,000, attacked the Duke of Hamilton’s Royalist forces at Preston Moor, a tidal plain just north of the River Ribble. Cromwell won a clear victory and from this point forward any Royalist hopes for the war were crushed.</p><hr></hr><img src='Flying Scotsman.jpg' alt='The Flying Scotsman' id='flyingscotsman' width=100% style='margin-bottom: 20px;'/><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>In the past, Preston was a major railway hub, serving trains on the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Today, it is part of the Virgin Trains Network and served by the Pendolino (a high speed train that swings pendulum-like on turns). British Rail was privatized between 1994 and 1997. I remember seeing The Flying Scotsman come through Preston on one of its last trips. This famed steam locomotive could make the 392 mile trip between London and Edinburgh in a little over four hours. The Pendolino takes two hours to travel from Preston to London, including three stops (230 miles).</p><hr></hr>"

I think St. Walburge’s Church is our most pleasing landmark, followed by the Harris Museum. Her Majesty’s Prison Preston, rebuilt in 1840, is a daunting example of Victorian design but unfortunately also known as one of the most overcrowded and brutal of English prisons.</p><hr></hr><img src='Kenny Baker.jpg' alt='Kenny Baker' id='kennybaker' width=100% style='margin-bottom: 20px;'/><p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>Kenny Baker, forever known as R2-D2, was a Preston resident, passing away in August of this year at the age of 81.</p><hr></hr><p style='font-weight: bold'>Other connections:<p style='margin-left: 12px;'>1.

The people of Preston remain the same: straightforward, plain spoken, quietly proud, and hard working. It’s unlikely you’d ever visit Preston and I’d be shocked to discover its inclusion in any guidebooks. Its terraced houses reveal strong industrial roots and generational poverty.
